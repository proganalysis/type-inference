  <dt><a href="java-annotation-design-20120703.html">3 July 2012</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Annotation syntax changes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        New receiver syntax.  It is permitted to write an explicit first
        formal parameter for the method receiver (<tt>this</tt>), which has
        no run-time effect nor any purpose other than serving as a place
        for the receiver annotation.  Then, no special case for receiver
        annotations is needed.
        For example, what was previously written as
        <pre>  public String toString() @Readonly { ... }</pre>
        is now written as
        <pre>  public String toString(@Readonly MyClass this) { ... }</pre>
        The syntax enables annotations on type parameters, outer
        <tt>this</tt> types, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Annotations are not permitted on class literals, nor arrays thereof.
      </li>
      <li>
        A type annotation on a nested type before the type's simple name,
        as in <tt>Map.@NonNull Entry</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an annotation has no @Target meta-annotation, then it applies
        only to the ElementTypes that were supported in Java SE 5.
        An annotation that is applicable to both types and declarations
        (which would be bad style) is permitted to be written on a
        <tt>void</tt>-returning method.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Classfile changes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rename <tt>extended_annotation</tt> to <tt>type_annotation</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a class file format for annotations on static nested classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the class file format for exception parameters (catch clauses).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove <tt>wildcard_bound</tt> and <tt>wildcard_bound_target</tt>.
        Wildcards are instead expressed in the location array used for type
        arguments, array element types, and static nested types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make <tt>typeparam_bound_target</tt> reserve an index for an
        implicit type variable upper bound of <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the <tt>target_type</tt> field of <tt>type_annotation</tt>
        from <tt>u1</tt> to <tt>u2</tt>, to
        permit future expansion and to improve word-alignment of the
        classfile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Renumber all the enumeration constants of <tt>target_type</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug fix: Java forbids type parameters in <tt>catch</tt>, not in
        <tt>throws</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Specification clarifications:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Clarify the difference between type uses and other type names that
        appear in Java code.  Examples of type names that are not type uses
        are <tt>import</tt> statements and class constants such as
        <tt>int.class</tt>.  Type annotations cannot be written on these
        type names.  This distinction now appears in the Java Language
        Specification as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarify that for a constructor result, there is no source code
        syntax for annotating its type parameters.  Constructor result
        annotations are stored in the classfile the same place as method
        return type annotations, using the METHOD_RESULT TargetType.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve discussion of compiler optimizations that remove an
        annotated cast. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The classfile representation of annotations does not depend on the
        source code representation.  Annotations that are implicit in
        the source code are present in the classfile.  Classfile
        indexing is with respect to the complete type, regardless of
        abbreviated types written in source code.  Classfile indexing
        assumes that all optional <tt>extends Object</tt> clauses are present.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Other specification document changes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Change grammar productions to be compatible with the grammar in
        chapter 18 of the Java Language Specification, Java SE
        7 version.  Remove section 5, merging the two lists of
        grammar changes into one list.  Separate the declaration annotation
        on type parameters from the list of type annotations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove two incorrect examples of inner class syntax.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add an appendix "Interactions with other Java SE 8 language changes".
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the "Other possible extensions to Java annotations" appendix.
        It will be maintained as a separate document.
        Also remove the "Logistical matters" appendix (Appendix E).
        Move all discussion of compiler modifications into an appendix.
        Eliminate Appendix B (discussion of changes), distributing its parts
        to section 2 (description of changes) and to Appendix A
        (motivation).
      </li>
      <li>
        Change "Java SE 7" to "Java SE 8".
        Change "Sun" to "Oracle".
        Update URLs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    FAQ:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add section "What is the relationship between the Type Annotations
        compiler and the OpenJDK compiler?"
      </li>
    </ul>

    Changes to normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Permit annotations on types in throws clause.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an annotation has no @Target meta-annotation, then it applies
        everywhere, not just the ElementTypes that were supported in Java SE
        6.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changes to classfile format:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Change extends/implements from using u1 to u2.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rename reference_info to target_info.
            Introduce names for each variant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clarify where attributes appear (on what element in the class file).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve discussion of annotations on compiler-generated methods
        (such as bridge methods).  Cut compiler-specific discussion.
      </li>
      <li>
        The grammar summary in Section 2.1 now separates type parameter
        declarations from type uses.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>

        potential future extension to the syntax. 
      </li>

    Changes to normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use terminology 'declaration annotation' for old Java SE 5/6
        annotations.
      </li>
      <li>
        An annotation with no @Target meta-annotation is
        treated as a declaration annotation, compatibly with the current
        behavior of Java SE 6.
      </li>
      <li>
        Classfile format changes:
        <ul>
        <li>
          In classfile, put declaration annotations and type annotations in
          different places.
        </li>
        <li>
          Better specification of array locations, which were only specified
          by example before.

  <dt><a href="java-annotation-design-20081114.html">14 November 2008</a></dt>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Allow annotations on type parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarify target_type for locations where Java 5 already allowed
        annotations:  method return type, method parameter, field.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Changes to non-normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is no commitment as to whether Oracle's javac will parse
        annotations in comments.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>    

  <dt><a href="java-annotation-design-20081020.html">20 October 2008</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Changes to non-normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Improve the discussion of repeated annotations and annotation
        inheritance, both adding new technical material and new motivating
        examples.  (Thanks to Niko Matsakis, Jonathan Aldrich, and others
        for the raw material.)
      </li>
      <li>
        In &ldquo;inheritance among annotations&rdquo; section, separate
        discussion of two approaches:  subclassing among annotations
        vs. extending/implementing interfaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mention two low-priority proposals for further annotation changes:
        nullable annotation fields and optional/default fields in annotations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make &ldquo;Annotations on statements&rdquo; a subsection of
        &ldquo;Locations for annotations&rdquo;.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="java-annotation-design-20080926.html">26 September 2008</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Changes to normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        In class file format, add missing fields from attributes for method
        parameter generic types and method type arguments.  Also
        cross-reference between the table of <tt>target_type</tt> and
        sections explaining the <tt>reference_info</tt> definition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add to-do item:  ambiguity in class file format for annotations on
        inner classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide a better citation for the JDK 1.5 class file format.
      </li>
      <li>
        Restructure introduction to section 4 (class file format), to
        separate the summary of the current class file from the summary of
        the changes.  Clarify other parts of section 4 as
        well.  This doesn't change the specification, just improves the
        writing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Changes to non-normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Separate reflection section into things that need to be done, and things
        that need not be done &mdash; it's mostly the latter!.  Also, delete old
        reflection proposal an replace it by a simpler yet more expressive one.
        (Both the old and the new are high-level and remain to be fleshed out.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Many writing improvements and clarifications,
        including discussions of duplicate annotations, subclassing annotations,
        and annotations as arguments to annotations, disambiguating type and
        declaration annotations, annotations on <tt>new</tt>, and receivers
        (including an explicit definition of the term
        &ldquo;receiver&rdquo;).  Also expand several examples
        to show actual declarations instead of just explaining them in the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        More extensive explanation of duplication issues with subclassing
        annotations.  Conclusion:  this should be deferred to the specific
        annotation processor, since there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
        Also, suggest that annotations that can be duplicated should be
        explicitly so marked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Undo one level of sectioning in appendix D (about possible other
        annotation changes).  Emphasize again that the
        specification is not set in stone.  Add another possible (but
        currently out of scope) extension to annotations:  the
        <tt>@ValueMember</tt> proposal for the <em>SingleElementAnnotation</em>
        grammar rule. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Add quotations from the (rather obscure) JSR 175 Design FAQ,
        explaining the rationale for several JSR 175 annotation design
        decisions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Why is it illegal [to] annotate a single element repeatedly
            with the same annotation type?
          </li>
          <li>
            Why can't you annotate arbitrary program elements such as
            blocks and individual statements?
          </li>
          <li>
            Why don't you support annotation subtyping (where one annotation type
          </li>
          <li>
            Why is it illegal for an annotation type to contain an element
            of the same type?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Changes to introduction:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reference the FAQ.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain the term &ldquo;JSR&rdquo; earlier in the document.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Changes to FAQ:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Emphasize backward compatibility.

      <li>
        New question on how to write a checker.

      <li>
        New question on why the Type Annotations Specification doesn't define
        annotation types.
      </li>
      <li>
        New question on how to determine the annotation on an object.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Make local variable info an array, to handle separate live ranges.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Changes to non-normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add new example of need for type qualifier annotations:  ThreadSafe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fix type in comment describing meaning of example variables.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dd>
    Changes to normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use new <code>ElementType.TYPEREF</code> enum constant for type
        annotations, instead of overloading the existing
        <code>ElementType.TYPE</code> enum constant.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Changes to non-normative section:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add new example of need for annotations on array elements (non-null type
        system with non-null default).
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarify the principle that annotations should not affect behavior:  in
        the absence of an annotation processor, the compiler produces the same
        bytecodes for annotated code as it would have for the same code
        without annotations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discuss backward-compatibility with Java 5 annotation processors,
        including reading annotations from files produced by Java 5 compilers,
        and putting annotations in files when the <code>-target 5</code>
        switch is supplied to javac.
      </li>
      <li>
        Note a problem with desugaring duplicate annotations into arrays:  it
        loses ordering information among different annotations.  Also add
        another approach to duplicate annotations:  adding a
        <code>getAnnotations</code> method like the current
        <code>getAnnotation</code> method.
      </li>
      <li>
        Expand discussion of permitting annotations to subclass one another,
        including providing some use cases and explaining some potential
        problems.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Editorial improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fix placement of figures in PDF version of document.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="java-annotation-design-20071015.html">15 October 2007</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Editorial improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>Use names, not numbers, for array annotation syntax proposals.
          Add 2 missing possibilities to the list of alternatives.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="java-annotation-design-20071010.html">10 October 2007</a></dt>
  <dd>
    New material:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Simplify JSR 308 webpage, and make proposal more self-contained, by
        moving &ldquo;Open issues&rdquo; into appendices of the design
        document.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reinstate design alternatives for array annotations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Editorial improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>Grammar changes now avoid deletions; annotations apply to a
          declaration whenever possible, and &ldquo;Type&rdquo; is used only in places
          that a pre-JSR308 annotation could <em>not</em> appear.
      </li>
      <li>Remove discussion of -typeprocessor; recent compiler
          changes make it unnecessary.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>Give syntax for varargs annotation.</li>
      <li>Expand list of target types for classfile format.</li>
    </ul>
    Editorial improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>Split document into normative main text and non-normative
          appendices that explain or amplify.  This makes the main text a
          manageable 8 pages (most of which is grammar changes anyway),
          which should be less off-putting to readers.</li>
      <li>Move design alternatives out of this document, for brevity.</li>
      <li>Rewrite old section on &ldquo;Disambiguating type and declaration
          annotations&rdquo; to be a new section &ldquo;Target
          meta-annotation for type annotations&rdquo;, to emphasize the
          purpose rather than the mechanism.</li>
    </ul>

          example syntax and example use sections consecutive.</li>

    </ul>
    Editorial improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>Many editorial changes suggested by Werner Dietl.</li>
      <li>Expand related work, particularly with respect to ownership types.</li>
